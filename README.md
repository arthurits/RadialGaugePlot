# Radial gauge plot
A customizable radial gauge control for plotting simple data. Built using C# (WinForms) in .NET 5.

The goal is two-fold:
* Integrate this plot into the [ScottPlot](https://github.com/ScottPlot/ScottPlot)
* Create a stand alone control (probably as a nuget packet) that's easy to mantain and update
