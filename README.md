# Radial gauge plot
A customizable radial gauge control for plotting simple data. Built using C# (WinForms) in .NET 5.

The goal is two-fold (work in progress):
* Integrate this plot into [ScottPlot](https://github.com/ScottPlot/ScottPlot), already present in version 4.1.18 onwards.
* Create a standalone control (probably as a nuget packet) that's easy to mantain and update.

## Developing status
Currently fine tuning some internal routines.
The `TestControl` project is functional and shows the functionally that is supported by the plot.

## Usage
Drag the control from the toolbox onto the form and cumtomize the plot as shown in the following code. The control does not refresh automatically. Instead, `Render()` should be invoked everytime it must be graphically updated.

```csharp
public FrmTestControl()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    
    plot1.Palette = Plotting.Colorsets.Palette.Microcharts;
    plot1.PlotTitle = "Example title";
    plot1.Update(new double[] { 100, 80, 65, 45, -20 },
                 new string[] { "alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta", "epsilon" });
    plot1.Legend.IsVisible = true;
    plot1.Legend.Location = RadialGaugePlot.Alignment.UpperRight;
    plot1.Render();
}
```
