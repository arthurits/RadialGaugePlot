# Radial gauge plot
A customizable radial gauge control for plotting simple data. Built using C# (WinForms) in .NET 5.

The goal is two-fold (work in progress):
* Integrate this plot into [ScottPlot](https://github.com/ScottPlot/ScottPlot), already present in version 4.1.18 onwards.
* Create a standalone control (probably as a nuget packet) that's easy to mantain and update
